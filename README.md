# EasierThanYouThink-iOS-App

"EasierThanYouThink" is a math-homework website created by one of our high school teachers. This project, designed and completed in Senior Year of High School, was to implement an iOS version of the website for mobile use.

Features include:
- Login authentication
- Course selection
- Homework Selection
- Questions with multiple choice answers set to timers
- Solutions for questions answered incorrectly

This application was finished in 2014, and worked on with my partner and friend "An Qi Zhang".
